# Batch Size Benchmark — How Batch Size Affects Throughput

This benchmark shows how generating multiple prompts at once (“batching”)
can speed up inference by better utilizing the model’s parallel compute.

## ⚡ Observed Latency

Average latency per batch (5 runs per size):

| Batch Size | Avg Latency (sec) |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| 1          | 1.5233            |
| 2          | 1.3181            |
| 4          | 1.4766            |
| 8          | 2.4881            |

## 📘 Beginner Interpretation

- Batching multiple prompts slightly increases latency per batch on CPU, but total throughput improves because more tokens are processed at once.
- Batch size 2 was faster than batch size 1 on this machine, showing the benefit of parallelization.
- Larger batches (4 or 8) start to slow down due to limited CPU cores and memory bandwidth; GPUs handle large batches more efficiently.

Takeaway: Even on CPU, moderate batching boosts throughput—but GPUs unlock the real gains.
