# 📘 **codex-systems-lab**

*A hands-on research and engineering lab exploring the systems, performance, and training foundations of AI coding models.*

This repository contains a curated set of experiments designed to demonstrate the technical depth required for **OpenAI’s Research Engineer, Codex** role. It covers:

* **Inference performance optimization**
* **Light LLM fine-tuning for code generation**
* **Agentic coding system behavior & latency profiling**
* **Reproductions of research findings**
* **Systems diagrams for LLM inference & agentic workflows**

This lab blends **ML research**, **systems engineering**, and **developer-experience insights**—mirroring the full-stack thinking required to push the frontier of AI coding models.

# 🔍 **Why This Lab Exists**

Modern AI coding systems (e.g., Codex, GPT-o series) combine:

* Large-scale model inference
* Context routing and retrieval
* Agentic loop orchestration
* Tool calling
* Performance-sensitive deployment environments
* Model evaluation and experiment design

This repo demonstrates the ability to reason **end-to-end across that entire stack**.

It is intentionally structured like a research notebook + engineering diagnostics toolkit.

# 🚀 **How to Get Started**

## 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ramirez-ai-labs/codex-systems-lab
cd codex-systems-lab
```

## 2. Set up the virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate  # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 3. Run your first experiment

For example, measure CPU vs GPU inference:

```bash
python 01_inference_profiling/benchmark_cpu_vs_gpu.py
```

Results will appear in:

```
01_inference_profiling/RESULTS.md
```

# ✔️ Summary

Yes — **the main README in the root should be the guide**.
Each folder has **minimal local docs**, but the root README is the *story, index, and map*.
This is industry standard and exactly what OpenAI reviewers expect.
